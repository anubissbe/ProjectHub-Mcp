# Project Completion Feature

## Overview
Added functionality to mark projects as completed directly from the project list view in the Task Management WebUI.

## Changes Made

### Frontend (React)
1. **Modified `/frontend/src/pages/ProjectList.tsx`**:
   - Added state tracking for project statistics
   - Added `completeProjectMutation` to handle project completion
   - Added `canCompleteProject` helper function to check if a project can be completed
   - Added "Complete" button that appears only for active projects with 100% task completion
   - Added completion rate display under each project name

### Features
- **Complete Button**: Green button that appears between "View" and "Delete" buttons
- **Validation**: Only shows for projects that are:
  - In "active" status
  - Have 100% task completion rate
- **Confirmation**: Asks for confirmation before marking as completed
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows completion percentage and task count for each project
- **Real-time Updates**: UI updates immediately after completion

### Backend Integration
The feature uses the existing backend API:
- `PUT /api/projects/:id` - Updates project status to 'completed'
- `GET /api/projects/:id/stats` - Fetches project statistics including completion rate

## Usage
1. Navigate to the project list at http://192.168.1.25:5173/
2. Look for active projects that show "100.0% complete"
3. Click the green "Complete" button
4. Confirm the action in the dialog
5. Project status changes to "completed" (blue badge)

## Technical Notes
- Uses React Query for data fetching and mutations
- Integrates with existing toast notifications for success/error feedback
- Follows the existing UI patterns and styling conventions
- No backend changes were required as the API already supported status updates
