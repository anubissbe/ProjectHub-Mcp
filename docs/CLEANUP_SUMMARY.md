# ProjectHub Cleanup Summary

## ðŸ§¹ Cleanup Completed

### Files Removed/Archived

1. **Deployment Reports** (11 files archived)
   - Moved to `archive/deployment-reports/`
   - These were temporary deployment status files

2. **Old Code Versions** 
   - `new-frontend/` â†’ archived
   - `frontend/index.html.bak` â†’ archived
   - `test-webhook-integration.js` â†’ archived

3. **Temporary Files**
   - `backend-deployment.tar.gz` - removed
   - `projecthub-deployment-package.tar.gz` - removed
   - `deploy-webhook-fix.sh` - removed
   - `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - removed (duplicate)

4. **Wiki Clone**
   - `ProjectHub-Mcp.wiki/` - removed (duplicate of wiki/)

### Structure Improvements

1. **Created Archive Directory**
   ```
   archive/
   â”œâ”€â”€ deployment-reports/  # Old deployment documentation
   â””â”€â”€ old-versions/        # Previous code attempts
   ```

2. **Updated .gitignore**
   - Added `archive/` to ignore list
   - Prevents archived files from being committed

3. **Created PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md**
   - Documents current project layout
   - Clarifies which directories are active

### Current Clean Structure

```
projecthub-mcp-server/
â”œâ”€â”€ backend-fix/         # Main backend (production)
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/            # React frontend
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/               # Documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/            # Utility scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/              # Test files
â”œâ”€â”€ screenshots/        # UI screenshots
â”œâ”€â”€ wiki/               # GitHub wiki content
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml  # Docker config
â””â”€â”€ Key files (.md)     # README, CHANGELOG, etc.
```

### Space Saved
- ~50 files removed/archived
- Cleaner repository structure
- Easier navigation for developers

### Notes
- `backend-fix/` is the production backend (not `backend/`)
- All old deployment reports are archived but not deleted
- Wiki content remains in `wiki/` directory only
