3. **Script Loading Order** - app.js loads before Alpine.js

5. **Database Schema** - Created with sample data

### 📁 Deployment Details

- **Synology Path**: `/volume1/docker/projecthub/`
- **Docker Network**: projecthub-network
- **Auto-restart**: All containers set to restart unless stopped

### 📝 Notes

- Port 8090 was already in use by KnowledgeHub, so frontend runs on 5174
- Port 5433 was already in use by KnowledgeHub, so PostgreSQL runs on 5434
- All services are configured to auto-restart
- Database has been initialized with sample projects and tasks
