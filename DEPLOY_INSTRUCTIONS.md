# ProjectHub-MCP Frontend Deployment Instructions

## The frontend has been dramatically branded with:
- **Black/Orange gradient backgrounds** throughout the UI
- **Larger, bolder typography** with font-black styling
- **Enhanced animations** including pulse, fade-in, and glow effects
- **Prominent borders and shadows** with orange accent colors
- **Scaled hover effects** (110% scale on buttons and links)
- **Gradient text effects** for headings
- **Custom branded loading states** with animated logo

## To deploy the new branding to your NAS:

### Option 1: Via Docker Exec (Recommended)
```bash
# SSH to your Synology NAS
ssh admin@192.168.1.24 -p 2222

# Execute build inside the frontend container
docker exec -it projecthub-mcp-frontend sh -c "cd /app && npm run build"

# The nginx server will automatically serve the new build
```

### Option 2: Manual Build
```bash
# On your local machine, build the frontend
cd /opt/projects/projects/ProjectHub-Mcp/frontend
npm run build

# Copy the dist folder to your NAS
scp -P 2222 -r dist/* admin@192.168.1.24:/volume1/docker/projecthub-mcp/frontend/dist/
```

### Option 3: Restart the Container
```bash
# SSH to your Synology
ssh admin@192.168.1.24 -p 2222

# Restart the frontend container to rebuild
docker-compose -f /volume1/docker/projecthub-mcp/docker-compose.yml restart frontend
```

## After deployment:
1. **Clear your browser cache** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Visit http://192.168.1.24:5173
3. You should see the dramatic new branding!
