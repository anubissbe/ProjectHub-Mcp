# GitHub Actions Queue Issue - Critical

## Problem Summary
All GitHub Actions workflows have been stuck in "queued" status for over 1 hour, which is abnormal. The billing report shows workflows consumed 81 minutes today, indicating they CAN run but are currently blocked.

## Current Status
- **15+ workflows queued** for 1+ hours
- **Startup failures** on complex workflows when they do run
- **Simple test workflows** also stuck in queue

## Root Causes (Requires Manual Fix)

### 1. **GitHub Actions Configuration** (MOST LIKELY)
**Action Required**: Go to https://github.com/anubissbe/ProjectHub-Mcp/settings/actions

Check these settings:
- [ ] **Actions permissions**: Ensure "Allow all actions and reusable workflows" is selected
- [ ] **Workflow permissions**: Check "Read and write permissions" is enabled
- [ ] **Fork pull request workflows**: Ensure appropriate settings

### 2. **Pending Workflow Approvals**
**Action Required**: Go to https://github.com/anubissbe/ProjectHub-Mcp/actions

Check for:
- [ ] Any workflows showing "Waiting for approval"
- [ ] First-time contributor approval requirements
- [ ] Manual approval requirements

### 3. **GitHub Actions Billing/Limits**
**Check**: https://github.com/settings/billing

Possible issues:
- Free tier limit reached (2,000 minutes/month)
- Payment method issues
- Spending limit set too low

### 4. **Repository-Specific Issues**
- Branch protection rules preventing workflow execution
- Repository archived or disabled (unlikely as pushes work)
- GitHub Actions beta features causing issues

## Technical Fixes Already Applied ✅
1. Removed all Unicode/emoji characters from workflows
2. Fixed conditional syntax (`if: false` → `if: ${{ false }}`)
3. Corrected secrets conditionals
4. Simplified workflows to minimal complexity
5. Validated all YAML syntax

## Diagnostic Commands
```bash
# Check current queue status
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/anubissbe/ProjectHub-Mcp/actions/runs?status=queued | jq '.total_count'

# View stuck workflows
./check-actions-status.sh

# Check specific workflow
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/anubissbe/ProjectHub-Mcp/actions/runs/16121165132 | jq '{status: .status, conclusion: .conclusion}'
```

## Evidence of Issue
- Workflows queued at 15:26 UTC (over 1 hour ago)
- Multiple push events trigger workflows that never start
- Even simplest workflow (`echo "Test"`) remains queued
- Billing shows 81 minutes used today (proving Actions CAN work)

## Next Steps
1. **Check repository Actions settings** (link above)
2. **Review Actions tab** for approval requirements
3. **Verify billing/usage** is not blocking execution
4. **Contact GitHub Support** if settings look correct

## Support Ticket Template
If contacting GitHub Support:

```
Repository: anubissbe/ProjectHub-Mcp
Issue: All workflows stuck in "queued" status for 1+ hours
- 15+ workflows queued since 15:26 UTC
- Usage report shows 81 minutes consumed today
- Simple test workflows also stuck
- No error messages provided
- Repository is public, not archived
```

## Temporary Workaround
Until resolved, consider:
1. Using local CI/CD tools
2. GitHub Actions on a different repository
3. Alternative CI/CD services (CircleCI, Travis CI)
