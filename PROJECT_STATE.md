## Current Status
- Last worked on: 2025-06-14
- Current task: Completed core functionality
- Branch: main

## Completed Features
- ✅ PostgreSQL project_management schema setup
- ✅ Express.js backend with TypeScript
- ✅ All REST API endpoints (CRUD for projects/tasks)
- ✅ PostgreSQL connection with pooling
- ✅ React frontend with TypeScript and Vite
- ✅ Tailwind CSS with dark mode support
- ✅ Theme toggle (dark/light) with persistence
- ✅ Layout component with navigation
- ✅ Project List page
- ✅ Kanban Board view with columns
- ✅ Task creation with modal form
- ✅ Task editing with full field updates
- ✅ Task deletion with confirmation
- ✅ Drag-and-drop between columns
- ✅ Task filtering and search
- ✅ Bulk task actions
- ✅ Pomodoro timer integration
- ✅ React Query for data fetching
- ✅ WebSocket service setup
- ✅ Puppeteer tests for UI verification

## Environment Setup
```bash
cd /opt/projects/project-tasks-webui

# Start both frontend and backend in Docker
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

## Access URLs
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:3001/api
- Health Check: http://localhost:3001/api/health

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
1. Implement real-time updates via WebSocket for collaborative editing
2. Add more analytics and progress charts
3. Task dependencies visualization
4. Time tracking reports
5. Export functionality (CSV, PDF)
6. User authentication and multi-user support
7. Task templates library
8. Recurring tasks
9. Task attachments
10. Activity history and audit logs

## Important Context
- Using existing PostgreSQL database (mcp_learning)
- project_management schema already has all tables
- MCP server connection not needed - direct DB access
- React + TypeScript for modern UI
- Both frontend and backend run in Docker containers
- PostgreSQL container needs to be on same network (already configured)
- Frontend uses Vite dev server in container
- Backend uses tsx watch for hot reloading

## Commands to Resume
```bash
cd /opt/projects/project-tasks-webui
source /opt/projects/export-vault-secrets.sh
# PostgreSQL is already running as mcp-postgres
```
