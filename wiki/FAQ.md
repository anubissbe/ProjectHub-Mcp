# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This FAQ covers common questions about the Task Management WebUI, including setup, usage, troubleshooting, and best practices.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Q: What are the system requirements?
**A:** Minimum requirements:
- **Development**: Node.js 18+, Docker, 4GB RAM, 2GB disk space
- **Production**: 2 CPU cores, 4GB RAM, 10GB disk space, Docker support
- **Browser**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+

### Q: How do I install the application?
**A:** The quickest way is using our pre-built release:
```bash
curl -L https://github.com/anubissbe/task-management-webui/releases/download/v1.0.0/task-management-webui-v1.0.0-full.tar.gz | tar -xz
docker compose up -d
```
See the [Installation Guide](Installation-Guide) for detailed instructions.

### Q: Can I run this without Docker?
**A:** Yes, but Docker is strongly recommended. For manual setup:
1. Install PostgreSQL 15+ with pgvector extension
2. Install Node.js 18+
3. Configure environment variables
4. Run `npm install` and `npm start` in both frontend and backend directories

**A:** Yes! After installation, access the application at `http://localhost:5173`. Sample projects and tasks are automatically created for demonstration.

## üë• User Management

### Q: How do I create user accounts?
**A:** Currently, the application runs in single-user mode for simplicity. Multi-user authentication is planned for future releases. You can track this feature request in our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/anubissbe/task-management-webui/issues).

### Q: Can multiple people use the same instance?
**A:** Yes, multiple people can use the same instance simultaneously. Real-time updates ensure everyone sees changes instantly. However, there's no user-specific data separation currently.

### Q: How do I set user permissions?
**A:** Role-based access control is not implemented yet. This feature is planned for v2.0. Currently, all users have full access to all projects and tasks.

## üìä Project Management

### Q: How many projects can I create?
**A:** There's no hard limit on projects. The system is designed to handle hundreds of projects efficiently. Performance depends on your hardware and database configuration.

### Q: Can I import projects from other tools?
**A:** Direct import tools aren't built-in yet, but you can:
1. Use the bulk create feature for tasks
2. Use the REST API to programmatically import data
3. Export from your current tool to CSV and manually import
4. Check our [Custom Integrations](Custom-Integrations) guide

### Q: How do I backup my projects?
**A:** Several backup options:
- **Database backup**: `docker exec task-management-postgres pg_dump -U mcp_user mcp_learning > backup.sql`
- **Export feature**: Use the built-in export to JSON/CSV
- **API backup**: Script using the REST API
- See [Backup & Recovery](Backup-Recovery) for details

**A:** Yes! Create a project with your ideal structure, then go to Project Settings ‚Üí "Save as Template". Your template will be available when creating new projects.

## üìã Task Management

### Q: What's the maximum task description length?
**A:** Task descriptions support markdown and can be up to 10,000 characters. For longer content, consider using attachments.

### Q: How do task dependencies work?
**A:** Tasks can have prerequisites that must be completed first. Dependent tasks are automatically marked as "blocked" until their dependencies are resolved. Dependencies are visualized in the Timeline view.

### Q: Can I set recurring tasks?
**A:** Recurring tasks aren't built-in yet, but you can:
1. Create task templates for repeated work
2. Use the bulk create feature
3. Clone existing tasks
4. This feature is planned for v1.2

### Q: How do I bulk update tasks?
**A:** In List view:
1. Select multiple tasks using checkboxes
2. Click "Bulk Actions" 
3. Choose: change status, assignee, priority, or delete
4. Apply changes to all selected tasks

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Tracking

### Q: How accurate is the time tracking?
**A:** Time tracking accuracy depends on user discipline:
